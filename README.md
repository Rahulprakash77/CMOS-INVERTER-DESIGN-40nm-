## Theory ( know about Inverter)
A simple inverter inverts the logically high input to low output and vice versa. It is of immense significance in clock generation, generation of delays, memories to store the data, improving the circuit's noise immunity, and much more. It is a simple two transistor device. For input 0, PMOS turns ON, and NMOS stays OFF. This charges the output capacitance, thus making output logic HIGH. Whereas for input 1, PMOS is OFF, and NMOS is ON. The charged capacitance now discharges, making output logic LOW. On a periodic application of pulse, an inverted pulse is obtained at the output. The in-depth analysis of the output on logic 0 to 1 at the input is summed up by its Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC).

## What is CMOS Inverter?

CMOS inverter definition is a device that is used to generate logic functions is known as CMOS inverter and is the essential component in all integrated circuits. A CMOS inverter is a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor), composed of a metal gate that lies on top of oxygen’s insulating layer on top of a semiconductor. These inverters are used in most electronic devices which are accountable for generating data n small circuits.

## CMOS Inverter Schematic Diagram

The logic element like an inverter reverses the applied input signal. In digital logic circuits, binary arithmetic & switching or logic function’s mathematical manipulation are best performed through the symbols 0 & 1. The CMOS inverter truth table is shown above. If the input logic is zero (0) then the output will be high (1) whereas, if the input logic is one (1), then the output will be low (0).

Rise Time or tr: Rise time is the time used to increase the signal from 10% to 90%.
Fall Time or tf: Fall time is the time used to drop the signal from 90% to 10%

The propagation delay from high to low or tpHL: The time used to drop from VOH – 50%.
The propagation delay from low to high or tpLH: The time used to increase from 50%- VOL.
Propagation Delay or tp: It is (tpHL + tpLH)/2.

### 1. DC Response (VTC Curve)
The DC response of an inverter characterizes its static behavior by plotting the output voltage against the input voltage, resulting in the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) curve, which defines key parameters such as the switching threshold, noise margins, and gain. Alongside the VTC curve, the drain current (Id) versus input voltage graph provides insights into the operating regions of the transistors (cutoff, linear, and saturation) during switching, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the inverter's performance.
